# Analysis of Stock Performance 2017/2018

## Overview of Project
### Purpose:  The purpose of this analysis was twofold.  Our primary objective was to analyze the performance of stocks based on their trading volume and annual returns and to readily ascertain what stocks perfomed well or poorly.  Our secondary objective turned out to be increasing the efficiency of the code (refactoring) so that the algorithms used herein will still be useful for much larger sets of stock data.

## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
